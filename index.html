                <h1>About Me</h1>
                <p>My name is Omar Shoreibah, a journalism major studying at the Philip Merrill College of Journalism at the University of Maryland. I am currently a sophomore, and I have attended many classes in my nearly four semesters at UMD. I have taken classes regarding intensive news writing, job experience, coding in three languages, and others developing skills needed for my future in journalism. I worked for the Black Explosion, a UMD paper, for a semester during my JOUR320 class, which gave me valuable experience in being a beat reporter, and having my work edited. I have learned to code in SQL, and am currently learning CSS and HTML. The College of Journalism has greatly expanded my experience and has sharpened my tool for exercising proper, accurate journalism. I have lived internationally, going to school in the US, Morocco, Egypt, Malaysia, Romania and Dubai. This has allowed me to have a multicultural experience throughout life, greatly improving my ability to communicate and assimilate myself wherever I am. I believe that my particular skill set and life experience is perfect for the journalist I want to become. </p>

                <h2>My Interests</h2>
                <p>I am an athletic person, interested in many sports, but mainly soccer and motorsport. I am also very interested in writing, which led me to pursue a career in journalism, and has motivated me to start writing a book. I like the pursuit of a story, where I feel I am making progress in investigating a particular issue, which has only grown my interest in journalism. These interests have led me to a possible pursuit in broadcast or investigative journalism, the former about sports, and the latter a local crime beat.</p>
